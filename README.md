Hello, my name is Daniyal. I'm 15 years old, and I learn code. Now I know:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python basics.
Soon I will know much more.

I live in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan.
I study in NIS IB. I'm in 9th grade.

My career started 11.02.2022, from learning HTML and CSS.
Then, after some time, I started to learn JavaScript.

Then, I created a plan how I will study now and later:
- Make up 4 simple templates without response
- Make up 2 simple templates with full response (and burger menu)
- Practice Javascript, by making simple web apps from scratch
- ...

After some period of time, I decided to choose another side of programming - GameDev. I really like it so it is much more interesting to me than creating websites. I decided to learn C++. I started to learn C++ on 01.11.2022.
